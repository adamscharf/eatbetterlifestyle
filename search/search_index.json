Let me know if you have any questions\u2026 we love sharing our experiences and helping others out. \n\n\nI would recommend checking out the \u201cForks over Knives\u201d documentary first. It\u2019s going to be the quickest and a fairly comprehensive overview for you. The books are great but obviously will take longer to read than watching a 1.5 hr movie.\n\n\nThe book that got us started was \"Engine 2 Diet\". \n\n\nRecipes:\n\n\nI think all of the attached recipes are for 2 servings, but Adam and I usually make 4 servings to have leftovers available. I would recommend doubling the recipes so you aren't cooking constantly. Everything heats up pretty well. The best oil-free hummus we've found is the one from the \"Artichoke Hummus Wrap\" but we just make the hummus from it. There are a couple delicious dessert recipes (Chocolate Chip Cookies and Peach Cobbler), burger recipes (Sneaky Chickpea and Mediterranean Bean - we skipped the olives), AMAZING tacos (you can use black beans instead of adzuki beans since they are difficult to find), pasta, pizza, cold, hot. Seriously though, if you have any questions or need any grocery shopping tips, just let me know!\n\n\nDocumentaries\n\n\n\n\nForks Over Knives \u2013 A GREAT overview of wfpb diet. You could definitely start here and get a good foundation of knowledge.\n\n\nWhat the Health \u2013 Follow up to Cowspiracy and investigates the influence of Meat/Dairy/Big Pharma companies over the health industry.\n\n\nCowspiracy \u2013 Talks about the big players in Meat and Dairy and how much control they really have\n\n\n\n\nBooks:\n1. Engine 2 Diet \u2013 This is where I started. Helped show me a wfpb diet can be viable solution for athletic men. Author is a world-renowned athlete.\n2. The China Study \u2013 Has a ton of proven data about the merits of a wfpb diet. It goes disease by disease and talks about how a wfpb diet can prevent, stop, and even reverse each one.\n3. Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease \u2013 The author of this book is a world-renowned cardiologist and has clinical data showing the effectiveness of switching to wfpb for people with very progressed cardiovascular disease. He is the father of the author of Engine 2 Diet.\n4. How Not to Die \u2014 In the middle of reading now. The author is the same doctor behind http://nutritionfacts.org and he goes through each disease killing Americans and talks about evidence based nutrition for how to minimize your risks.\n\n\nThe rest of these I have yet to read but have heard good things about either them or their author\n\n\n\n\n7 Day Rescue Diet \u2014 By the same author as Engine 2 Diet and is his latest book\n\n\nWhole \u2013 By the same author of The China Study.
