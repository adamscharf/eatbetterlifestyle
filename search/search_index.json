We knew we had to change our eating habits to become healthier people. It began when we made the decision to visit a registered dietician. Over the course of about a year, we started tracking our calories, eating less processed foods, and making healthy substitutions compared to our prior diet. It worked. We both started losing weight instead of gaining. However, in March 2017, we took it to a whole new level. Adam read the book Engine 2 Diet and decided that for optimum health, he was going to follow a Whole-Foods, Plant-Based (WFPB, for short) diet for 28 days. Dawn reluctantly joined in and gradually cut out animal products over those 4 weeks. This was the change that transformed everything! The weight for both of us just started melting off. Even beyond what we had already lost. After a few months of getting accustomed to our newfound diet, we both made the decision to start seriously running. Adam completed his first half marathon in January 2018 and we are both training to complete a full marathon in October 2018. When you first commit to something so \u201cdrastic\u201d, you feel lost. We didn\u2019t know what to eat, how to make it, what herbs and spices to use, or how to explain it. Over time, we both continued learning and expanding our knowledge about WFPB and the science behind why the nutrition works. We\u2019ve never stopped trying new recipes! While it hasn\u2019t always been easy, it\u2019s what got us here and we wouldn\u2019t trade our newfound health for anything.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-us","text":"In April 2016, we realized that we both needed to do something about our climbing weight.
