We knew we had to change our eating habits to become healthier \npeople. It began when we made the decision to visit a registered dietician. \nOver the course of about a year, we started tracking our calories, eating less \nprocessed foods, and making healthy substitutions compared to our prior diet. \nIt worked. We both started losing weight instead of gaining. However, in March \n2017, we took it to a whole new level. Adam read the book \nEngine 2 Diet\n and \ndecided that for optimum health, he was going to follow a Whole-Foods, \nPlant-Based (WFPB, for short) diet for 28 days. Dawn reluctantly joined in and \ngradually cut out animal products over those 4 weeks.\n\n\nThis was the change that transformed everything!\n\n\nThe weight for both of us just started melting off. Even beyond what we had\nalready lost. After a few months of getting accustomed to our newfound diet, we \nboth made the decision to start seriously running. Adam completed his first half \nmarathon in January 2018 and we are both training to complete a full marathon in \nOctober 2018.\n\n\nWhen you first commit to something so \u201cdrastic\u201d, you feel lost. We didn\u2019t know \nwhat to eat, how to make it, what herbs and spices to use, or how to explain it. \nOver time, we both continued learning and expanding our knowledge about WFPB and \nthe science behind why the nutrition works. We\u2019ve never stopped trying new \nrecipes! While it hasn\u2019t always been easy, it\u2019s what got us here and we wouldn\u2019t \ntrade our newfound health for anything.",
