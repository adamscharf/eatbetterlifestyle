# About us
 
In April 2016, we realized that we both needed to do something about our 
climbing weight. We knew we had to change our eating habits to become healthier 
people. It began when we made the decision to visit a registered dietician. 
Over the course of about a year, we started tracking our calories, eating less 
processed foods, and making healthy substitutions compared to our prior diet. 
It worked. We both started losing weight instead of gaining. However, in March 
2017, we took it to a whole new level. Adam read the book _Engine 2 Diet_ and 
decided that for optimum health, he was going to follow a Whole-Foods, 
Plant-Based (WFPB, for short) diet for 28 days. Dawn reluctantly joined in and 
gradually cut out animal products over those 4 weeks.
 
**This was the change that transformed everything!**
 
The weight for both of us just started melting off. Even beyond what we had
already lost. After a few months of getting accustomed to our newfound diet, we 
both made the decision to start seriously running. Adam completed his first half 
marathon in January 2018 and we are both training to complete a full marathon in 
October 2018.
 
When you first commit to something so “drastic”, you feel lost. We didn’t know 
what to eat, how to make it, what herbs and spices to use, or how to explain it. 
Over time, we both continued learning and expanding our knowledge about WFPB and 
the science behind why the nutrition works. We’ve never stopped trying new 
recipes! While it hasn’t always been easy, it’s what got us here and we wouldn’t 
trade our newfound health for anything.
