"We all have different disease risks due to our different genes. But while we 
will never know every risk to which we are predisposed, we do know how to 
control those risks. Regardless of our genes, we can all optimize our chances 
of expressing the right genes by providing our bodies with the best possible 
environmentâ€”that is, the best possible nutrition."  

\- The China Study, T. Colin Campbell
