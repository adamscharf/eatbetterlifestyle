# Resources

Here are all of the latest tools, and then some, that brought me to where I am 
today. It may seem like an overwhelming amount of information but I would
recommend just starting with either "Forks Over Knives" or "What the Health", 
then going from there.

The book that got me started was "[The Engine 2 Diet](#engine-2-diet)"
 

## Documentaries

## Podcasts

### Plant Yourself Podcast

- This podcast covers a wide range of topics and is not always related to food, 
but they approach things from a plant-based perspective and talk a lot about 
self-improvement and bettering yourself and the environment, which I appreciate.

### Thought for Food

_No longer creating new episodes_

- I’ve only recently started listening to this podcast but you should definitely 
listen to the “Transitioning to a Plant-Based Lifestyle” episode from 1/28/16. 
They come from an athlete perspective too and help break the stereotypes.

### Nutrition Facts with Dr. Greger

- Short episodes focused on one health topic. Especially helpful for targeted 
information like allergies, vitamin supplements, joint health, etc.
