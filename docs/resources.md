Here’s a starting list of materials to check out. I think you’ll find these resources contain a LOT of compelling evidence in favor of a wfbp diet. Let me know if you have any questions… we love sharing our experiences and helping others out. 
 
I would recommend checking out the “Forks over Knives” documentary first. It’s going to be the quickest and a fairly comprehensive overview for you. The books are great but obviously will take longer to read than watching a 1.5 hr movie.

The book that got us started was "Engine 2 Diet". 

## Recipes:
I think all of the attached recipes are for 2 servings, but Adam and I usually make 4 servings to have leftovers available. I would recommend doubling the recipes so you aren't cooking constantly. Everything heats up pretty well. The best oil-free hummus we've found is the one from the "Artichoke Hummus Wrap" but we just make the hummus from it. There are a couple delicious dessert recipes (Chocolate Chip Cookies and Peach Cobbler), burger recipes (Sneaky Chickpea and Mediterranean Bean - we skipped the olives), AMAZING tacos (you can use black beans instead of adzuki beans since they are difficult to find), pasta, pizza, cold, hot. Seriously though, if you have any questions or need any grocery shopping tips, just let me know!

## Podcasts
* Plant Yourself Podcast – This podcast covers a wide range of topics and is not always related to food, but they approach things from a plant-based perspective and talk a lot about self-improvement and bettering yourself and the environment, which I appreciate.
* Thought for Food – I’ve only recently started listening to this podcast but you should definitely listen to the “Transitioning to a Plant-Based Lifestyle” episode from 1/28/16. They come from an athlete perspective too and help break the stereotypes.
* Nutrition Facts with Dr. Greger – Short episodes focused on one health topic. Especially helpful for targeted information like allergies, vitamin supplements, joint health, etc.

One of my favorite quotes so far is from the China study about optimizing our chances:

"We all have different disease risks due to our different genes. But while we will never know every risk to which we are predisposed, we do know how to control those risks. Regardless of our genes, we can all optimize our chances of expressing the right genes by providing our bodies with the best possible environment—that is, the best possible nutrition."
