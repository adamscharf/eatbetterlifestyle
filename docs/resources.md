Here’s a starting list of materials to check out. I think you’ll find these resources contain a LOT of compelling evidence in favor of a wfbp diet. Let me know if you have any questions… we love sharing our experiences and helping others out. 
 
I would recommend checking out the “Forks over Knives” documentary first. It’s going to be the quickest and a fairly comprehensive overview for you. The books are great but obviously will take longer to read than watching a 1.5 hr movie.

The book that got us started was "Engine 2 Diet". 
 
## Documentaries

1. Forks Over Knives – A GREAT overview of wfpb diet. You could definitely start 
here and get a good foundation of knowledge.
2. What the Health – Follow up to Cowspiracy and investigates the influence of 
Meat/Dairy/Big Pharma companies over the health industry.
3. Cowspiracy – Talks about the big players in Meat and Dairy and how much 
control they really have

## Podcasts


### Plant Yourself Podcast
This podcast covers a wide range of topics and is not always related to food, 
but they approach things from a plant-based perspective and talk a lot about 
self-improvement and bettering yourself and the environment, which I appreciate.


### Thought for Food

I’ve only recently started listening to this podcast but you should definitely 
listen to the “Transitioning to a Plant-Based Lifestyle” episode from 1/28/16. 
They come from an athlete perspective too and help break the stereotypes.


### Nutrition Facts with Dr. Greger

Short episodes focused on one health topic. Especially helpful for targeted 
information like allergies, vitamin supplements, joint health, etc.
