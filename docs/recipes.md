## Baked Breaded Eggplant

### Ingredients

- 1-1 ½ large Italian eggplant (peeled or unpeeled, up to you)
- ½ cup unsweetened soymilk
- 1 - 1 ½ cups plain breadcrumbs or panko (sometimes I use a little of both)
- ½ couple of pinches of dried italian seasoning
- salt and fresh ground pepper
- olive oil spray, optional

### Directories

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
1. On your cutting board, cut off both ends of your eggplant. Using a sharp knife carefully slice your eggplant lengthways into 1/2" slices. (Here' a great post for a visual how-to cut an eggplant into slices)
1. Once my eggplant is sliced up I lay the slices out onto baking racks or pans and sprinkle the slices with kosher or coarse salt. This will pull out the moisture and any bitterness from the eggplant. I let it sit in the salt for about 15-30 minutes.
1. While your eggplant is sitting, season your breadcrumbs with salt, pepper, parmesan and Italian seasoning (you can always use store bought Italian seasoned breadcrumbs if you like). Set up an assembly line: sliced eggplant, whisked eggs, shallow dish of seasoned breadcrumbs and lightly greased baking sheets (I spray mine with cooking spray).
1. Rinse salt off eggplant and pat dry well with dish towels or paper towels. I like to press down as I'm drying to really pull out all the water. Once eggplant is pressed dry, you are ready to bread.
1. Dip your eggplant slice into the egg, removing any excess egg before dipping into breadcrumbs. Press eggplant slice into breadcrumbs on both sides until coated well. Place into baking sheet. Repeat until all slices are breaded.
1. At this time, spray each breaded eggplant slice with olive oil spray (or cooking spray).
1. Bake in oven heated at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes. Flip each slice over and bake for another 15 minutes until eggplant slices are golden brown. Keep an eye on your eggplant, if some slices are thinner than others they may brown up quicker.
1. To store in freezer: Lay a freezer bag flat on counter and layer cooled baked eggplant slices alongside each other (slightly overlapping) in the bag. I try to find a flat surface in the freezer to store them until they are frozen. Once they are frozen flat they are easier to store.
1. To serve from freezer: You can defrost ahead of time if you like, or take straight from freezer and warm up in 350 degree oven or toaster oven.

## Crispy Baked Tortilla Strips (Oil-Free)

**Cook Time:** 20 min, **Servings:** 5

### Ingredients

- 6 corn tortillas  
- Sea salt (optional)  
- Water in a misting spray bottle  
- Parchment paper  

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350º. Prepare 2 large baking sheets with a lining of parchment paper on the bottom.
2. Spray a corn tortilla with a little water using a misting spray bottle. (The water makes the salt stick to the tortilla.) Sprinkle tortilla lightly with salt. (optional) Repeat with the other two tortillas. Stack the 3 salted tortillas on top of each other and cut into thin, 1/8 inch strips, using a pizza cutter.
3. Place tortilla strips on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. (Parchment paper is the key to getting these no-oil strips perfectly crispy, and to keep them from sticking to the pan without using oil.) Bake in a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees for 7-9 minutes, or until the strips are just starting to brown lightly on the ends. (Watch closely so they don’t over brown)
4. Remove strips from the oven and place baking sheet on a cooling rack.(Strips will still be slightly slightly pliable, but will continue to crisp further as they cool.)
5. Serve strips immediately on top of a taco salad, burrito bowl, or bowl of chili, etc., or transfer cooled strips to an airtight container for storage. (Strips should stay fresh for one to two weeks, if kept airtight.)
