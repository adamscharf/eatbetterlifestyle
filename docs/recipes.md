## Spicy Cashew Cheese Sauce

**Servings:** ¾ cup

**Ingredients:**

½ cup raw cashews, soaked at least 30 minutes (overnight if possible), drained, water reserved
5 tablespoons reserved soaking water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
½ teaspoon white or brown soy miso (or chickpea miso)
½ teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon (or less) crushed red pepper

**Directions:**

1. Combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until creamy. Add additional water to achieve the consistency you desire. 
2. This can be stored for up to 1 week in the refrigerator. Leftover sauce makes a great dip for tortilla chips.

    To make this less spicy or not spicy, simply reduce or remove the amount of crushed red pepper.
